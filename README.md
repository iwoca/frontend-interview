## iwoca frontend interview test (application portal)

### Setup

1. Clone this repo to your local machine, its a project created using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
1. Make sure you are using the correct node version:
   1. Manually: `node -v` should return `18.16.0`
   1. If you don't have Node version manager (NVM) [install install it from here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
   1. Using `nvm`: Run `nvm install` to install the node version and `nvm use` to use it
1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` to start the `frontend` on `localhost:3000` and the api server on `localhost:3001`

### The Task

Currently there is only one application which is shown using a hard coded JSON fixture in the codebase

The applications api http://localhost:3001/api/applications will return a JSON object of all applications for that user

You can paginate the endpoint using the query string `?_page=2&_limit=5` you must return 5 new applications every time the load more button is clicked, `_page=` is the page you will be returning and `_limit=` is number of applications to return

Meta data on the applications can be found on the `Link` header on any paginated response.

see attached [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/5NOBLAgL17n4qoR82vhYY5/iwoca---frontend-developer.-test?node-id=0%3A1&t=EMSHOn1fDlCrdgaC-1) for how this should look

1. There is a pre styled `<Button />` component you can use for this.
1. Any comments you want to pass along to the reviewer add to [COMMENTS.md](./COMMENTS.md) and commit
1. To submit either send us a link to your public fork or another public repo. Alternatively you can zip up your files minus `node_modules` and email it over.

### Notes

- We consider tests important here at iwoca. Jest/Vitest are our preferred way of writing them, but you can use cypress or another library if more comfortable. This exercise uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). It offers a very similar API to Jest with additional performance gains.
- Feel free to alter the technologies used in the code base, eg. we use CSS modules but if you are more comfortable with `styled-components` for example you can install and use that for your portion of the task.
- Attention to detail in the design will go a long way.
- The task focusses mainly on desktop but we would be very happy to see mobile considered.
- Remember to check your project runs before submitting. - we will be running it in development mode to review.
- Feel free to refactor the code where appropriate.
